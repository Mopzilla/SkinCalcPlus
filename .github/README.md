## Live Battle Tracker
Battles are tracked live allowing you to determine the winner before the battle has finished without having to add it up yourself.
For people who like the guessing game and seeing the big reveal at the end, the stats are hidden by default and must be enabled by pressing the "SHOW STATS" button!
### Sharing Mode Pool
For sharing mode battles a number displays the total value of all items pulled so far, as well as displaying the split each player will receive.
If you manage to hit positive, the red underline will change to green to show it immediately!

### Crazy Mode Support
When crazy mode is enabled the colors are inverted, so the lowest valued battle slot shows as green as opposed to the highest.
This also applies to the team pools.
